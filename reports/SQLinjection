## Introduction
SQL injection is a common web application vulnerability that occurs when malicious SQL statements are inserted into user-supplied data, allowing attackers to manipulate the application's database. This report aims to explore SQL injection prevention technique.

## Methodology
To investigate SQL injection prevention, the following research strategies will be employed:

### Research Strategies
1. Internet Research: Gathering information from trusted sources, security websites, and development forums to understand SQL injection prevention techniques.
2. Case Studies: Analyzing real-world examples of SQL injection attacks and the corresponding prevention measures employed.
3. Expert Interviews: Conducting interviews with cybersecurity professionals and web developers to gain insights into their approaches and best practices for preventing SQL injection.

### Instruments
- Internet research
- Case studies
- Expert interviews

### Limitations
- The scope of this report is focused on SQL injection prevention in the context of CORS.
- The research is limited to the available resources and expertise of the researcher.

## Results
SQL injection prevention involves implementing various techniques and best practices to mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks. Some key strategies include:

Preventing SQL injection involves implementing techniques and practices to reduce the risk of attacks. Key strategies include:

1. Input Validation: Validate user input to ensure trusted and expected data is processed.

2. Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries: Use statements that separate SQL logic from user input.

3. Least Privilege Principle: Grant minimal privileges to limit the impact of attacks.

4. Regular Security Patching: Keep software up to date to address vulnerabilities.

5. Security Testing and Code Review: Assess system vulnerabilities through testing and audits.

6. Security Education and Awareness: Train personnel on secure coding practices.

7. Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Use firewalls to detect and block suspicious requests.

Implementing these strategies helps mitigate SQL injection risks. Regular updates and a proactive approach are essential to stay ahead of emerging threats.
