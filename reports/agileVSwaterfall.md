### Overview of Agile Project Management

Agile project management is a flexible and collaborative approach to handling projects[^1]. It involves dividing tasks into smaller pieces and working closely with teammates. The goal is to make regular improvements and meet customer needs throughout the project. Instead of following a strict plan, the team adapts to changes as they arise. This method allows for better communication, quicker feedback, and the ability to deliver valuable results in a more efficient manner.

### Overview of Waterfall Project Management

Waterfall project management is a step-by-step approach where tasks follow a strict order[^2]. It has phases like planning, analyzing, designing, implementing, and testing[^3].
The delivery date and budget will be set at the beginning of the project so there is a clear view of the time and money neccessary, but it is less flexible and may not work well for complex or projects in a quick changing environment.

### Comparison of Agile and Waterfall


Agile and waterfall are different ways to manage projects. Agile is more flexible and collaborative, with frequent adjustments and client feedback. Waterfall follows a step-by-step process, where each stage must be finished before moving forward[^4]. Agile focuses on adaptability and improvement, while waterfall emphasizes planning and documentation. The choice depends on the project's needs.


## Conclusion

Agile is generally seen as a better choice for software projects because it offers flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability. It allows for making changes along the way, getting quick feedback and focusing on requirements and stakeholder needs. This leads to more content stakeholders and better project results.
