<h1>Cultural differences between Finnish and Dutch students</h1>


Introduction:
This report aims to provide a brief overview of the cultural differences between Finnish and Dutch students.  

In this report the Hofstede index[^7] is used, it is a tool developed by Geert Hofstede to compare cultural differences between countries on multiple aspects.

In the case of Finnish and Dutch students, two aspects of the Hofstede index stand out:

</br>

Finnish culture values independence and personal achievements. Finnish students often prefer working alone and appreciate having their own space. On the other hand, Dutch culture emphasizes teamwork and collaboration. Dutch students tend to be social and enjoy working in groups.

2.0 Long-Term Orientation:

</br>
Finnish students have a long-term orientation, valuing persistence, patience, and considering future outcomes. They prioritize sustainability and are willing to adapt to changing circumstances while considering the long-term consequences of their decisions.


Also, (not on the Hofstede index):

3.0 Communication Style: Finnish students tend to be reserved and prefer direct communication. They rely on non-verbal cues and expect concise expressions of opinions[^1].
In contrast, Dutch students are generally more open and expressive, valuing direct and honest communication[^2].

3.1 While working with the students when we were visiting Oulu, I noticed that the finnish students were indeed more reserved than us Dutch people.
This did not result in any communication errors as we were all honest and direct to each other during our conversations.

4.0 Punctuality: Both Finnish and Dutch students generally value punctuality. 
However, Dutch students may have a more relaxed attitude towards time and adopt a flexible approach. Finnish students, on the other hand, place a high emphasis on punctuality and value efficiency[^5].

4.1 When whe arrived back in the Netherlands and had to work remotely from the Finnish part of our team, we needed to be punctual when it came to meetings and delivering tasks we were assigned on time. This came with some difficulties as the Finnish students had different school schedules and holidays. But there were no big troubles in the end.


Conclusion:
In conclusion, there are a few cultural differences between Finnish and Dutch students. 
These differences manifest in communication style, individualism vs. collectivism,  as well as attitudes towards punctuality. 
Recognizing and respecting these differences can help cross-cultural communication and collaboration among students from both backgrounds.
